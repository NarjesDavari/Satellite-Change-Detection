# Satellite-Change-Detection

We proposed an unsupervised LCD method by exploiting the vision foundation model SAM. The process commences with image acquisition, where a sequence of two images is captured. Since these images are for different dates, they have different resolutions and contrast; therefore, pre-processing steps to eliminate Gaussian noises and atmospheric interferences are essential.

the framework is:

and some of the results for two public datasets and one case study from the north of Portugal are:
